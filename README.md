# HyprDevs-Internship


Project Summary:

I completed a simulated robotics project where I designed and programmed an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot using Arduino. Through this project, I gained experience with robotics concepts, Arduino programming, and sensor integration. I developed a simulated robot that can detect obstacles and navigate around them, demonstrating my understanding of robotics and programming principles.

Skills Gained:

- Robotics and automation
- Arduino programming
- Sensor integration (ultrasonic and IR sensors)
- Motor control and movement simulation
- Autonomous systems
- Problem-solving and debugging
